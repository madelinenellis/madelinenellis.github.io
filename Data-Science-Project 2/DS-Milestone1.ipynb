The USDA provides information on barge movements through New Orleans and Jefferson Parish with multiple data sets regarding the commodity or material, season, locks, and location along the river. We plan to use these datasets to analyze the effect of increased rates of barge traffic with air quality and water quality data. We will compare these two sets of data in order to research their overlap and reach a possible conclusion. \n","\n","For this milestone we have loaded the barge movement data into a jupyter notebook. This data was already easy to read and demonstrated the principles of tidy data, but we added a column to show the tons moved per week on the barges to help our analysis. One of the biggest challenges for this data was choosing which fields to extract from the database. There are many different options and since we haven’t done much analysis yet it is hard to predict what we may need. We extracted what we thought would be best for our analysis for now, but will most likely have to go back and pull other fields from the database.\n","\n","We are still in pursuit of finding datasets that accurately encompass the rates of wildlife and land loss, but if we are able to discover data that would be usable, we would definitely incorporate those findings into our final project. These datasets would be particularly useful in answering questions regarding the long-term impact of barges due to the lack of natural soil dispersion and over use of dredging. Water quality data of the Mississippi could also provide us with valuable findings regarding wildlife diversity loss. \n","\n","We have discussed how we plan to collaborate on the project and we decided to have weekly catch up meetings and discuss what else we want to accomplish for that week. We have set up a private GitHub repo that we will use to share our findings and code with one another.
